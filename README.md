# Code/example plots for next-generation sequencing and target capture

This repository contains code used in my thesis, to generate graphs and draw 
conclusions from genomic data gathered by using novel target capture and 
next-generation sequencing methods.

The scripts folder contains analysis scripts in Python. The Snakefile contains
commands/rules to help with parts of the genomics pipeline such as read mapping, etc.
The samtools/sratoolkit folders contain additional tools used in the pipeline.
Additional details are provided in the thesis pdf.
